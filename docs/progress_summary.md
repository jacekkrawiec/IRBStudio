# IRBStudio Progress Summary

## Current Status (September 29, 2025)

The IRBStudio project has made significant progress toward its goal of creating a comprehensive AIRB Scenario & Impact Analysis Engine. Below is a summary of achievements and next steps.

### Completed Work

1. **Project Foundation (Feature 1)** âœ“
   - Set up project structure, dependencies, and basic infrastructure
   - Implemented configuration schemas with Pydantic
   - Created data loaders for portfolio data and configurations
   - Established a robust logging system

2. **Core Simulation Engine (Feature 2)** âœ“
   - Implemented the procedurally-faithful PD simulation engine
   - Created statistical components (Beta mixture distribution fitter, migration matrix calculation)
   - Built score generation logic with target AUC capability
   - Developed the hybrid portfolio simulation approach

3. **RWA Calculators** âœ“
   - Implemented abstract base calculator framework
   - Created both AIRB and SA calculators for mortgages
   - Added comprehensive unit tests

4. **OOP Refactoring** âœ“
   - Successfully converted the procedural simulation approach to OOP
   - Created the `PortfolioSimulator` class with clear separation of concerns
   - Enhanced encapsulation by moving score generation functionality into the `BetaMixtureFitter` class
   - Cleaned up obsolete code and removed redundant files

5. **Monte Carlo Framework** âœ“
   - Implemented the core Monte Carlo simulation infrastructure
   - Added parallel processing capabilities
   - Incorporated random seed management for reproducibility

### Current Work in Progress

1. **Monte Carlo Analytics** ðŸ”„
   - Developing result aggregation methods
   - Implementing statistical analysis for Monte Carlo outputs
   - Working on histogram data generation for visualization

### Next Steps

Based on the project plan and current progress, the following areas should be prioritized:

1. **Complete Monte Carlo Analytics** (High Priority)
   - Finish implementing summary statistics and percentile calculations
   - Develop visualization data structures for Monte Carlo outputs
   - Write comprehensive unit and integration tests

2. **End-to-End Pipeline & Reporting** (Next Major Feature)
   - Implement orchestration through the main API
   - Create Plotly-based reporting functions
   - Develop visualization components for RWA distributions

3. **Performance Optimization** (Important for Scalability)
   - Address the bottlenecks identified in profiling
   - Optimize the `_apply_migrations_optimized` method
   - Implement vectorized operations where possible

4. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Create example notebooks with complete workflows
   - Document the API and core concepts
   - Develop a user guide

5. **Testing Expansion**
   - Create more comprehensive unit tests
   - Add integration tests for end-to-end simulation
   - Implement benchmarks to track performance

## Achievements Beyond Original Plan

The project has exceeded initial expectations in several areas:

1. **Enhanced OOP Structure**
   - The refactoring to OOP went beyond the initial plan, creating a more robust, maintainable codebase
   - The integration of score generation into the `BetaMixtureFitter` class improves encapsulation

2. **Performance Profiling**
   - Conducted detailed performance analysis to identify bottlenecks
   - Gathered insights for targeted optimization

## Timeline Assessment

The project is making good progress and is on track with the MVP development plan. The core simulation engine and calculators are complete, and work on the Monte Carlo analytics is advancing well. The next significant milestone will be completing the reporting and visualization components.

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on Monte Carlo Analytics Completion**: This is the bridge between the simulation engine and the reporting components.

2. **Begin Work on Simple Visualizations**: Even without the complete analytics, starting on basic visualizations will provide valuable feedback.

3. **Consider Implementing Performance Optimizations**: As the codebase stabilizes, addressing the performance bottlenecks will ensure scalability.

4. **Start Documentation Early**: Begin documenting the API and core concepts now, while the design decisions are fresh.
